            <p>I love playing games and vacationing with my wife and kiddos. I also enjoy writing creative fiction, drawing, reading, anime, movies n shows, longboarding, and something else I/'m forgetting right now, but all of those are second fiddle compared to the video games and vacay with the fam.</p>
