        description: "My son learned to walk, my daughter dropped my wife's coffee, and my other daughter lost my wife's wallet and passport. I bought weed from a complete stranger (which was about as good an idea as it sounds) but overall we had so much fun I can't even describe it all. We went to the Polynesian Cultural Center, watched fire breathing, spent hours at the beach, and hiked a volcano. 11/10 would recommend.",
